## Choosing Design

You can go with the alien or if you're more adventurous, you can make or buy a different one. If you choose to buy one but the site e.g. requires an expensive membership, use Google image search to find a better deal.

## Making the Front Layer

1. Print the mask on a transparent self-adhesive foil. I had it done at a local copy center.

2. Stick the self-adhesive foil to the one-way mirror foil.

3. Cut around the edges.

## Things I Could Have Done Better

- make the front layer slightly wider so that it bends better
- take better care of it (it got stolen)

----------
- glowing mirror effect
- tape until silicone dries
