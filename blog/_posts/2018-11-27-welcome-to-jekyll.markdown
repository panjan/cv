The awesome [Glowing Mirror Mask tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/glowing-mirror-mask/introduction) by Adafruit inspired me to make this Halloween mask. The main differences are that I used a cool alien design and cheaper parts. Also the image is printed (not cut into vinyl) which allows us to use any shapes and even colours.

## Required Skills

- you should be able to blink a LED on Wemos (make sure you have drivers from Espressif installed)
- soldering

## Parts and Materials

All of the parts can be ordered from eBay or AliExpress.

## Choosing Design

I've chosen [this vector image](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/sign-of-space-aliens-gm906014358-249808396) because it has wide edges that perfectly hide the LEDs so they don't shine directly in your eyes. The €9 price seems reasonable for the time it saved me. If you're adventurous, make or buy a different design. I used the free SVG editor Inkscape to erase the background.

TIP: If you're buying an image, use Google image search to find the best price.

## Making the Front Layer

Print the mask on an A4 transparent self-adhesive foil. You can do this at home if you have a suitable printer and transparency foil. I had it done at a local copy centre. Make sure you crop the image as much as possible so that there are no margins when you print it. For an adult-sized mask the A4 format is just wide enough.

*This is how the image looks printed on a transparency foil.*

2. Stick the self-adhesive foil to the one-way mirror foil.

3. Cut around the edges using a utility knife.

## Making the Back Layer

Use the front layer as Cut out the felt and holographic foil layers.

5. Glue the holographic foil to the felt layer.

## Attaching the LED Strip

6. Sew the led strip.

7. Cut a hole for the connector and pull it through.

8. Isolate the end of the led strip.

9. LED strip test.

## Attaching the Front Layer

10. Glue the front layer to the LED strip using silicone glue. I used tape to hold everything together.

## Connecting the Board

11. Solder.

12. Strenghten connections using hot glue gun.

13. Sew wemos to the inside of the mask.

## Final Touches

14. Cover the wemos with some felt (use hot glue gun).

15. Sew the flexible strip.

15. Enjoy a stout.

## Things I Could Have Done Better

- make the front layer slightly wider so that it bends better
- take better care of it (it got stolen)
