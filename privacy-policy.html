        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Like millions of other website owners, I use Google Analytics on <a href="/">honza.me</a>.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics is a piece of software that grabs data about my visitors (you). It&#8217;s something like an advanced server log.</p>
        <h2>What does Google Analytics record?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>What website you came from to get here.</li>
          <li>How long you stay for.</li>
          <li>What kind of computer you're using.</li>
          <li>And quite a bit more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What do I do with your data?</h2>
        <p>The tracking information allows me to better understand the kind of people who come to my site and what content they&#8217;re reading. This allows me to make better decisions about design and writing.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, I will compile aggregate statistics about the number of visitors this site receives and browsers being used. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting.</p>
        <p>All of my activity falls within the bounds of the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>.</p>
        <h2>Want to opt out of tracking?</h2>
        <p><a onclick="optOut()" href="#">Opt out of tracking</a> (sets a cookie to disable my tracking). This only works on honza.me.</p>
        <p>You can also <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">use a browser plugin to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking software</a>.</p>
